the [Takahashi method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Takahashi_method) in C#

Inspiration taken from [*sent*](https://tools.suckless.org/sent/) by the suckless community.

## How it works
Presentations are created with a plain text file that you can edit in any text editor.

You can split slides with 2 newlines (like markdown). This allows you to have multiple lines on a slide. You can create empty slides by making a slide with `!`.
